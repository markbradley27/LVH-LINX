LVH-LINX
========

This is a forked LINX repo for the puropse of adding quadrature encoder support. Everything is very experimental and untested at the moment, so use at your own risk.

TODOs:
* Bailing on QE Set Precision command, so QE Read should probably be 0xA1, not 0xA2
* myRIO is completely unsupported and broken, I don't really know how any of that works
